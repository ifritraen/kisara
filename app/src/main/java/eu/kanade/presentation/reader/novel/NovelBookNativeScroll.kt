 * command queue and no acknowledgement: a renderer that was rebuilt underneath the core simply
 * reads the window again, which is what used to need a document-ready hook and a "forget what is
 * rendered" call on the core side.
 *
 * The section payload is generic so this layer can be unit tested without a parser or Compose.
