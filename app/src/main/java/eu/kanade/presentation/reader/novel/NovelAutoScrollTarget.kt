 * The single scrollable thing auto-scroll drives.

 * page reader and native lazy list - and every branch repeated the same frame bookkeeping around
 * three genuinely different operations: "is this paginated", "move by N pixels and tell me what was
 * consumed", "can it still move forward". This interface is that seam, so the loop can stay one
 * body and each surface only describes itself.
 *
 * Implementations deliberately reproduce the exact semantics of the branch they replace, including
 * the places where the old code reported the *requested* pixels instead of the consumed ones.
